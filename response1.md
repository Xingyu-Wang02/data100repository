# Being a Humbler data Scientist
Data is often used by companies to understand people. How the data is used varies greatly from how google and Facebook sells their user information, to how scientist conduct experiments to better understand human nature. But he focusses of this response is more on how data can be used to further human development, and how the people who process the data can benefit from being a bit humbler. 
Blumenstock through his article shows his hope and issues with today’s data science in the context of human development. The Promise within data science is how powerful of a tool it can be to better people’s lives. Potentially, data can improve workers ability to respond to crises and improve how humanitarian aid can react to issues like the COVID epidemic we have faced the past year. With data, aid is enhanced: but only when the data is processed in the right way. This leads to his second point which he titles “the pitfalls”.
One issue he pointed out is that often the solutions presented form big data help empower the wealthier than the vulnerable. Essentially, one idea here is that the data we collect is mostly concentrated on those who have mobile phones, and sometimes its those who cannot afford one that needs help. Something interesting about this is that my father actually works in something similar to this. In Indonesia, where I’m from, there are a lot of street stores that handle all their transactions through cash and written documentation. One thing my dad has attempted to do is that he’s built an app through which their transactions have become recorded which essentially works similarly to the digital credit example as banks use that data as credit scores so that they can trust these stores more.
Essentially most of these “pitfalls” that Blumenstock points is are associated with not properly representing the populous who needs help. So then comes in how to move forward from this point. This is where the idea of being humble most comes into play. What I think he means be being humble is that the people who interpret and collect these data should be willing to accept that they need help to better understand the data they are given. And that they should be open to adjusting and adding on to their work. I think this is most strongly illustrated by the point he makes with deepening collaboration. In this point Blumenstock highlights how many of the innovations within data science comes from engineers in Silicon Valley, who have good intentions. These people quite understandably would not fully understand the data they are working with and its important for them to more deeply understand the context of the data they’ve collected. To do that they need to work together with those who are directly involved with the issues they are trying to fix. With I think a humbler data scientist would do is understand they need help. They reach out. Sometimes good intentions aren’t enough, the attitude and approach we take while working greatly impacts the effectiveness of the work. 
All the quotes that were posed with the response essentially deal with being a humbler data scientist. A lot of people want to do good in the world, but our approach to doing that is important. We have to be transparent with our need for help, and those who are more involved with these issues should be open to receiving help. This goes beyond just accepting aid, but also means being actively a part of the solution. And lastly the idea of the balancing act mostly has to do with our mentality in approaching problems. Data scientist know the great potential to embitter the world but its hard to focus on that when “pitfalls” keep coming up. The mentality of recognizing these issues but not being discouraged by them, as well as remembering the good you can do but not being blind to the issues you will face. This is how I interpret the ideas within the quotes presented within this response.
